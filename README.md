## About Me

A data-driven Mathematics undergraduate passionate about transforming raw data into meaningful insights. With hands-on experience in administrative data processing and reporting at Badan Pusat Statistik (BPS) Temanggung Regency, I focus on developing analytical and visualization skills through Excel-based projects.
